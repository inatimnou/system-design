Mosquitoes are among the most dangerous vectors of human diseases, transmitting malaria, dengue, Zika, and other infections. However, conventional methods of mosquito control, such as insecticides and larvicides, have limitations such as environmental impacts, resistance development, and high costs. Therefore, alternative methods of mosquito control are needed to reduce the burden of mosquito-borne diseases.

One of the most promising methods is biological control, which involves using natural enemies or agents to reduce the population or impact of mosquitoes. Biological control can be more eco-friendly, target-specific, and sustainable than chemical methods. In this article, we will explain what biological control of mosquitoes is, how it works, and what are its advantages and disadvantages. We will also provide some links to download PDF files that contain more information on this topic.
  
## What is Biological Control of Mosquitoes?
 
Biological control of mosquitoes is defined as the reduction of the target population by the use of predators, parasites, pathogens, competitors or toxins from microorganisms[^1^]. Biological control aims to reduce the target population to an "acceptable" level and, at the same time, to avoid adverse effects to the ecosystem. As far as mosquito control is concerned, biological control measures should integrate the protection of humans from mosquitoes with conservation of the biodiversity while avoiding toxicological and eco-toxicological effects[^2^].
 
There are different types of biological control agents that can be used against mosquitoes, such as:

- **Predators:** These are animals that feed on mosquito larvae or adults, such as fish, frogs, dragonflies, beetles, spiders, birds, bats, etc. Predators can be introduced or enhanced in mosquito breeding sites to reduce their numbers.
- **Parasites:** These are organisms that live on or in mosquito larvae or adults and cause harm to them, such as nematodes, mites, wasps, flies, etc. Parasites can be released or encouraged in mosquito habitats to infect and kill them.
- **Pathogens:** These are microorganisms that cause diseases in mosquito larvae or adults and reduce their survival or reproduction, such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, etc. Pathogens can be applied or disseminated in mosquito breeding sites to infect and kill them.
- **Competitors:** These are organisms that compete with mosquito larvae for food or space in aquatic habitats, such as algae, plants, copepods, etc. Competitors can be introduced or promoted in mosquito habitats to reduce their resources and growth.
- **Toxins:** These are substances produced by microorganisms that are toxic to mosquito larvae or adults but not to other organisms. Toxins can be isolated or synthesized from bacteria (e.g., Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis), fungi (e.g., Metarhizium anisopliae), algae (e.g., cyanobacteria), etc. Toxins can be sprayed or applied in mosquito breeding sites to kill them.

## How Does Biological Control of Mosquitoes Work?
 
The mode of action of biological control agents varies depending on their type and target stage of mosquitoes. For example:

- **Predators:** They consume mosquito larvae or adults by biting, chewing, sucking, or swallowing them. Predators can reduce the density and survival of mosquitoes by direct predation or by inducing behavioral changes (e.g., avoidance) in them.
- **Parasites:** They attach to or penetrate into mosquito larvae or adults and feed on their tissues or fluids. Parasites can reduce the fitness and reproduction of mosquitoes by causing damage (e.g., deformation), mortality (e.g., emergence failure), or sterilization (e.g., Wolbachia) in them.
- **Pathogens:** They enter into mosquito larvae or adults through ingestion (e.g., bacteria), contact (e.g., fungi), injection (e.g., viruses), or inhalation (e.g., protozoa) and multiply inside them. Pathogens can reduce the health and performance of mosquitoes by causing symptoms 8cf37b1e13
