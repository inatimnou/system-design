LISREL is a software program that allows you to perform structural equation modeling (SEM), a statistical technique that can test complex relationships among observed and latent variables. SEM can be used for various purposes, such as testing hypotheses, evaluating theories, measuring constructs, and assessing model fit. LISREL is one of the most popular and widely used SEM software programs in the world, with a history of more than 50 years of development and innovation.

In this article, we will introduce you to LISREL 2021, the latest version of the software that offers many new features and improvements. We will also show you how to download and use LISREL 2021 for free for a limited time.
 
## What is new in LISREL 2021?
 
LISREL 2021 is the first software of its kind that utilizes the innovative statistical methodism to handle, decompose and compare the unobservable, the theory factors of structural equation modeling. The methodological software offers basic and advanced methods for estimating and testing in structural equation modeling. This software creates graphs and performs statistical diagnostics that let you check the model fit. It is used to estimate the model, measure the fit of the model and analyze the internal and external fit of the model. This software is widely used in many research fields like marketing, social sciences and educational research. It is also the simplest package of structural equation modeling software[^2^].
 
Some of the new features and improvements in LISREL 2021 are:
 
- LISREL 2021 is a 64-bit application that can handle large and complex data sets with ease.
- LISREL 2021 can perform standard and multilevel SEM for complete and incomplete data from simple random and complex survey designs.
- LISREL 2021 can handle categorical and continuous variables as well as ordinal, nominal, count, censored, truncated, binary, multinomial, Poisson, negative binomial, normal, gamma, and inverse Gaussian distributions.
- LISREL 2021 can perform exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, regression analysis, mediation analysis, moderation analysis, latent growth curve modeling, latent class analysis, mixture modeling, multigroup analysis, longitudinal analysis, missing data analysis, multiple imputation, bootstrap estimation, robust estimation, Bayesian estimation, Monte Carlo simulation, power analysis, model comparison, model selection, model modification, model validation, model averaging, model testing, model diagnostics, model interpretation, model presentation and more.
- LISREL 2021 has a user-friendly interface that allows you to create models using graphical or syntax modes. You can also import models from other software programs such as SPSS AMOS or Mplus.
- LISREL 2021 has a comprehensive help system that provides tutorials, examples, references and technical support for users of all levels.
- LISREL 2021 has a library of predefined models that you can use or modify for your own research purposes.
