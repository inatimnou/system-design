GT Legends is not only a game for nostalgia, but also a game for challenge. The game offers five difficulty levels, ranging from easy beginner mode to ultra realistic simulation mode. The higher the difficulty, the more realistic the physics, damage and car setups are. You will also face more skilled and aggressive AI opponents, who will not hesitate to bump you off the track or block your overtaking attempts.
 
If you want to master the game, you will need to learn how to handle each car's unique characteristics, such as weight, power, grip and handling. You will also need to adjust your driving style according to the track conditions, weather and time of day. Some tracks are more suited for fast and powerful cars, while others require more finesse and precision. You will also need to pay attention to your tire wear, fuel consumption and engine temperature, as they can affect your performance and reliability.
 
To help you improve your skills, the game offers a practice mode, where you can drive any car on any track without any opponents or time limits. You can also use the driving aids, such as traction control, ABS and stability control, to assist you in controlling your car. However, using these aids will lower your score and limit your progress in the career mode. The game also features a replay system, where you can watch your races from different camera angles and analyze your mistakes.
