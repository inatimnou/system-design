## More Sounds, More Quality
 
One of the main selling points of Hypersonic is its vast sound library that covers almost every musical genre and style. From acoustic instruments to electronic synths, from drums and percussion to loops and phrases, Hypersonic has it all. However, some users have complained that some of the sounds are outdated, low quality or too generic. Therefore, Hypersonic 3 could benefit from a major overhaul of its sound engine and sample content, adding more realism, detail and diversity to its sonic palette.
 
For example, Hypersonic 3 could include more multisampled instruments with multiple velocity layers and articulations, such as strings, brass, woodwinds, pianos and guitars. It could also incorporate more advanced synthesis methods, such as wavetable, granular or physical modeling, to create more expressive and dynamic sounds. Moreover, Hypersonic 3 could expand its loop and phrase collection with more genres, tempos and variations, as well as offering more control over slicing, editing and rearranging them.
 
## More Compatibility, More Flexibility
 
Another aspect that Hypersonic 3 could improve on is its compatibility and flexibility with different platforms, hosts and formats. While Hypersonic 2 works as a VST plugin and an Audio Units plugin for macOS and Windows, some users have reported issues with newer operating systems or DAWs. Therefore, Hypersonic 3 could ensure that it supports the latest versions of macOS and Windows, as well as other popular plugin formats such as AAX or VST3.
 
In addition, Hypersonic 3 could offer more options for integrating with other software and hardware devices. For instance, it could allow users to import their own samples or presets from other sources, such as Steinberg's own Halion Sonic or Yamaha's Motif XF. It could also enable users to export their sounds or patches to other formats or platforms, such as iOS or Android devices. Furthermore, Hypersonic 3 could provide more MIDI functionality and automation capabilities, such as polyphonic arpeggiator, chord detection or macro controls.
