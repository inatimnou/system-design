True Lies was a huge success at the box office, grossing over $378 million worldwide and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1994. It also received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised the film's humor, action, and chemistry between Schwarzenegger and Curtis. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture â Musical or Comedy for Curtis.
 
The film is also notable for being one of the first Hollywood films to feature a nuclear explosion in a major city. The scene where Harry and his partner Albert (Tom Arnold) chase the terrorists through the Florida Keys and end up on the Old Seven Mile Bridge was filmed using a real bridge that was scheduled to be demolished. The filmmakers obtained permission from the authorities to blow up part of the bridge and used 40 cameras to capture the explosion from different angles.
 
Another memorable scene from the film is the tango dance between Harry and his wife Helen (Curtis), who is unaware of his true identity. The scene was inspired by the 1992 film Scent of a Woman, where Al Pacino dances the tango with Gabrielle Anwar. Cameron hired Pacino's tango instructor to teach Schwarzenegger and Curtis how to dance. The scene was filmed in one take and took three hours to complete.
