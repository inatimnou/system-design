Carslaw and Jaeger, Conduction of Heat in Solids (1959) PDF Zip is a book that has stood the test of time and has been widely praised for its clarity, rigor, and comprehensiveness. The authors, Horatio Scott Carslaw and John Conrad Jaeger, were both eminent mathematicians and physicists who made significant contributions to the field of heat conduction and other areas of applied mathematics. They wrote the book with the aim of providing a systematic and unified treatment of the subject, based on the methods of classical analysis and modern mathematical physics.
 
The book is divided into 18 chapters, each of which deals with a specific aspect or application of heat conduction in solids. The first chapter introduces the general theory and basic equations of heat conduction, as well as some useful concepts and techniques such as dimensionless parameters, similarity solutions, superposition principle, and Green's functions. The next six chapters focus on the infinite and semi-infinite solids, linear flow of heat in bounded solids, periodic flow of heat, cylindrical and spherical solids, conduction with heat sources, and surface heating and cooling. These chapters cover a wide range of problems and solutions involving different geometries, boundary conditions, initial conditions, heat sources or sinks, and temperature distributions.

The following six chapters deal with more advanced topics such as melting and freezing, geophysical applications, anisotropic and moving media, substances with variable thermal properties, integral transforms, and numerical methods. These chapters explore the effects of phase change, earth's crustal temperature, thermal stresses, thermal conductivity tensors, moving boundaries or media, temperature-dependent properties, Laplace transform, Fourier transform, Hankel transform, finite difference methods, finite element methods, and other numerical techniques on heat conduction problems. The last six chapters are appendices that provide some mathematical background and useful tables for solving heat conduction problems.
