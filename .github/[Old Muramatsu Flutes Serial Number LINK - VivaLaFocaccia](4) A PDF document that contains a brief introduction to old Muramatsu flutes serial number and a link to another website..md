## Check the Serial Number
 
The serial number is the most important clue to identify and date your old Muramatsu flute. It is usually stamped on the body of the flute, near the foot joint. The serial number consists of five digits, sometimes preceded by a letter.
 
The letter indicates the model of the flute. For example, A stands for Artist model, S for Standard model, EX for EX model, etc. If there is no letter, it means that the flute is either a very old model or a custom-made model.
 
The five digits indicate the production number of the flute. The higher the number, the newer the flute. However, the production number does not correspond to the year of manufacture directly. You need to contact Muramatsu America or Muramatsu Japan with your serial number to find out the exact year of your flute.
