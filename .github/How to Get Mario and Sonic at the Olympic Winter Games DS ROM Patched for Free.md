# How to Play Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on Nintendo DS with a Patched ROM
  
If you are a fan of Mario and Sonic, you might want to play their crossover game, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, on your Nintendo DS. This game was released in 2009 and features various winter sports events that you can compete in with characters from both franchises. However, you might encounter some problems if you try to play this game with a downloaded ROM file, as it has an anti-piracy protection that prevents it from running on emulators or flashcards.

Fortunately, there is a way to bypass this protection and enjoy this game on your device. All you need is a patched ROM file that has been modified to remove the anti-piracy check. In this article, we will show you how to get and use a patched ROM file for Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on Nintendo DS.
  
## Step 1: Download a Patched ROM File
  
The first thing you need to do is to download a patched ROM file for Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games. You can find one on various websites that offer ROM downloads for Nintendo DS games, such as WoWroms[^1^] or ConsoleRoms[^2^]. Make sure you download the USA version of the game, as the patch only works for that region.
  
Alternatively, you can also patch your own ROM file if you have a clean copy of the game. To do this, you need to download a patching tool called Mario And Sonic At The OlymÃ­c Winter Games (U) [4274] Fix Patch[^3^] from GBATemp. Then, run the tool and select your clean ROM file when prompted. The tool will automatically patch your ROM file and save it as a new file.
  
## Step 2: Transfer the Patched ROM File to Your Device
  
Once you have a patched ROM file for Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, you need to transfer it to your device. Depending on what device you are using, there are different ways to do this.
  
If you are using an emulator on your computer or smartphone, such as DeSmuME or DraStic, you just need to copy the patched ROM file to the folder where your emulator stores its games. Then, launch your emulator and select the game from its menu.
