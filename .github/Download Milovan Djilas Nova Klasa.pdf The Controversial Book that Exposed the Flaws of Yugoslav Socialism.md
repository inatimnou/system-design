The New Class is a controversial and influential work that challenged the legitimacy of the communist regimes and inspired many dissidents and reformers. It is also a personal testimony of Djilas's own disillusionment and struggle with the system he once served and defended.

Djilas wrote The New Class in 1956, after he was expelled from the Yugoslav Communist Party and imprisoned for his criticism of Stalin and the Soviet intervention in Hungary. He smuggled the manuscript out of prison and published it abroad in 1957. The book caused a sensation in the West and provoked a fierce backlash from the communist authorities, who denounced Djilas as a traitor and a renegade.

In the book, Djilas analyzes the historical origins and development of the communist system, from the Russian Revolution to the Cold War. He argues that the communist ideology is a rationalization of the new class's interests and ambitions, and that the communist revolution is a betrayal of the original socialist ideals. He criticizes the totalitarian nature of the communist state, which suppresses all forms of freedom, democracy, and culture. He also warns of the dangers of the nuclear arms race and the global confrontation between the two blocs.
 
Djilas proposes a radical alternative to the communist system: a democratic socialism that respects human rights, pluralism, and self-management. He advocates for a peaceful coexistence and cooperation among nations, and for a social transformation based on moral values and human dignity. He expresses his hope that the new class will eventually lose its power and legitimacy, and that the people will rise up against it.

The New Class is a seminal and provocative book that has influenced many thinkers and activists, both in the communist and non-communist world. It has been praised for its courage, originality, and insight, and criticized for its oversimplification, inconsistency, and pessimism. It has also been accused of being a self-justification of Djilas's own role and actions in the Yugoslav communist movement.
 
Despite its flaws and limitations, The New Class remains a relevant and stimulating work that challenges the reader to question the nature and consequences of the communist system, and to envision a better and more humane society. It is a book that deserves to be read and discussed by anyone interested in the history and future of socialism.

One of the most interesting and controversial aspects of Djilas's book is his concept of the new class. He defines the new class as the ruling elite of the communist system, composed of the party officials, bureaucrats, managers, and intellectuals. He argues that the new class has a monopoly of political and economic power, and that it exploits and alienates the workers and peasants. He also claims that the new class is a universal phenomenon, and that it exists in all communist countries, regardless of their specific conditions and differences.
 
Djilas's concept of the new class has been widely debated and criticized by various scholars and commentators. Some have argued that Djilas exaggerates the homogeneity and coherence of the new class, and that he ignores the diversity and conflicts within it. Others have pointed out that Djilas fails to explain how the new class emerged and consolidated its power, and that he neglects the role of external factors and historical circumstances. Still others have challenged Djilas's assumption that the new class is inherently opposed to democracy and socialism, and that he overlooks the potential for reform and change within the communist system.
