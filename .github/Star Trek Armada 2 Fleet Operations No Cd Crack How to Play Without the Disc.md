## Why Do You Need a CD to Play Fleet Operations?
 
Fleet Operations requires the original Armada 2 CD to run because it uses some of the files and resources from the base game. The mod does not replace the original game, but rather installs as a separate program that launches from its own executable file. However, the mod still checks for the presence of the CD in your drive before launching. This is a form of copy protection that prevents unauthorized distribution of the game.
 
## How to Play Fleet Operations Without a CD?
 
There are two main ways to play Fleet Operations without a CD: using a virtual drive or using a no-CD crack. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, so you should choose the one that suits you best.
 
### Using a Virtual Drive
 
A virtual drive is a software that creates an image of your CD on your hard drive and emulates it as if it was inserted in your physical drive. This way, you can play Fleet Operations without having to insert your CD every time. To use this method, you will need:
 
- A working Armada 2 CD
- A virtual drive software such as VirtualDrive or Daemon Tools
- A program that can create an image of your CD such as ImgBurn or Alcohol 120%

The steps are as follows:

1. Insert your Armada 2 CD in your physical drive and run the program that can create an image of it.
2. Select your CD drive as the source and choose a destination folder on your hard drive where you want to save the image file.
3. Choose an appropriate format for the image file such as ISO or BIN/CUE.
4. Start the process and wait until it finishes.
5. Eject your Armada 2 CD from your physical drive and close the program.
6. Run the virtual drive software and create a new virtual drive on your computer.
7. Select the image file that you created earlier and mount it on your virtual drive.
8. Run Fleet Operations from its executable file and enjoy playing without a CD.

The advantages of this method are:

- You do not need to download any illegal or potentially harmful files from the internet.
- You do not need to modify any files or folders in your Fleet Operations installation.
- You can easily switch between different versions of Fleet Operations or other mods by mounting different image files on your virtual drive.

The disadvantages of this method are:

### Using a No-CD Crack
  
A no-CD crack is a modified version of the original executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to play Fleet Operations without a CD. To use this method, you will need:

- A no-CD crack file that matches your version of Fleet Operations
- A backup copy of your original executable file in case something goes wrong

The steps are as follows:

1. Download a no-CD crack file from a reliable source such as GameCopyWorld or ConsoleBackup. Make sure it is compatible with your version of Fleet Operations and has positive feedback from other users.
2. Extract the no-CD crack file from its archive using a program such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Navigate to your Fleet Operations installation folder and locate the armada.tgt file. This is 8cf37b1e13
