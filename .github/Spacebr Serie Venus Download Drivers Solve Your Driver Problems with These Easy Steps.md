# How to Download Drivers for SpaceBR Serie Venus Computers
 
If you have a SpaceBR Serie Venus computer and need to download drivers for it, you may be out of luck. SpaceBR was a Brazilian company that produced computers, tablets, netbooks and other devices, but it went bankrupt in 2015 and left no official website or support for its products. However, there are some ways you can try to find the drivers you need.
 
## Method 1: Use the Device Manager
 
The Device Manager is a Windows tool that lets you see and manage the hardware components of your computer. You can use it to check the status of your devices, update their drivers, or uninstall them if they are causing problems. To access the Device Manager, follow these steps:

2. Expand the category of the device you want to update, such as Display adapters, Network adapters, or Sound, video and game controllers.
3. Right-click on the device and select Update driver.
4. Choose Search automatically for updated driver software and wait for Windows to find and install the best driver for your device.
5. If Windows cannot find a driver, choose Browse my computer for driver software and select a folder where you have downloaded drivers from another source.
6. Repeat this process for any other device you want to update.

## Method 2: Use a Third-Party Driver Updater
 
If you don't want to manually search and install drivers for your SpaceBR Serie Venus computer, you can use a third-party driver updater software that can scan your system and find the best drivers for your devices. However, be careful when choosing a driver updater, as some of them may come with unwanted programs or malware that can harm your computer. Here are some tips to avoid such risks:

- Only download driver updaters from reputable sources, such as official websites or trusted download platforms.
- Avoid clicking on ads or pop-ups that claim to offer free driver updates or scans.
- Read the user reviews and ratings of the driver updater before downloading it.
- Check the license agreement and privacy policy of the driver updater before installing it.
- Uncheck any boxes that offer to install additional programs or change your browser settings.
- Scan your computer with an antivirus program after installing the driver updater.

## Method 3: Use the Manufacturer's Website
 
Another way to find drivers for your SpaceBR Serie Venus computer is to visit the website of the manufacturer of the device you want to update. For example, if your computer has an Intel processor, you can go to Intel's website and download drivers for it. Here are some common manufacturers of computer hardware and their websites:
